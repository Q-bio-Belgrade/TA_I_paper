# MATLAB Code for Reproducing Results

This repository contains MATLAB code to reproduce results from the paper:

**"Bistability in Type I Toxin-Antitoxin Systems May Lead to Stress-Induced Persister Formation"**  
by Sofija Markovic, Magdalena Djordjevic, Hong-Yu OU, and Marko Djordjevic

## Scripts

Each script in this repository is designed to reproduce the paper results. Scripts are annotated with comments describing their functionality. 

## Phase Portrait Plotter

- **Phase Portrait Plotter**: Modified version of the original code (available at [MathWorks File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/81026-phase-portrait-plotter)) used for Figure S2. The modifications were made for visual consistency with the paper's figures.

## Notes

- The code is developed with MATLAB R2024a but should also be compatible with earlier versions.
- Ensure that all required MATLAB toolboxes are installed for the scripts to run correctly. (Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox)
- If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the comments within each script or contact Sofija Markovic at [sofija.markovic@bio.bg.ac.rs](mailto:sofija.markovic@bio.bg.ac.rs).
